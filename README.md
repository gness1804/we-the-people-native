**We The People** is an application created in React Native that allows a user to track current Congressional bills and new laws. Using the [Sunlight Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/), the application brings in data on bills and laws including title, date introduced, date of last action, sponsor, current progress (in House Committee, passed by Senate, enacted...), and other data. This application is meant for concerned citizens (and non-citizens) to keep track of Congressional actions and to be better informed and empowered to take action on critical issues.
